For this project in particular. I took Boostrap 4 out for a spin.

Building the main page was done using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, 
Popper.js, Boostrap 4, and Font Awesome.

Creating this website template using Bootstrap 4 and utilizing 
hosted libraries was awesome. I see a difference that really makes me happy.

The differences that I perceive are in the format and structure of the page which look
professionally made with a modern attractive style. Mind blowingly amazing!

To build the index page it had to have a responsive layout with a simple structure in mind. 
Having that thought in mind is what helps me figure out how my website templates will look like.

Added the metadata for SEO purposes to enhance effective web searches for it to appear 
on search engines is a must have for every website. Keep that in mind.

The main functionality of Bootstrap 4 is that whenever the page resized it fits every image,
buttons, words, and layout to fit on smaller display devices. These include phones & tablets.

Read my code to understand how it was made. 

Download it as a .zip folder and run it on a text editor.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Christian R.
